        <h1>Kotesh Rekha does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>The Theree Sisters Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p>[The old garden at the house of the PROSOROVS. There is a long avenue
            of firs, at the end of which the river can be seen. There is a forest
            on the far side of the river. On the right is the terrace of the house:
            bottles and tumblers are on a table here; it is evident that champagne
            has just been drunk. It is midday. Every now and again passers-by walk
            across the garden, from the road to the river; five soldiers go past
            rapidly. CHEBUTIKIN, in a comfortable frame of mind which does not
            desert him throughout the act, sits in an armchair in the garden,
            waiting to be called. He wears a peaked cap and has a stick. IRINA,
            KULIGIN with a cross hanging from his neck and without his moustaches,
            and TUZENBACH are standing on the terrace seeing off FEDOTIK and RODE,
            who are coming down into the garden; both officers are in service
            uniform.]
            
            TUZENBACH. [Exchanges kisses with FEDOTIK] You're a good sort, we got on
            so well together. [Exchanges kisses with RODE] Once again.... Good-bye,
            old man!
            
            IRINA. Au revoir!
            
            FEDOTIK. It isn't au revoir, it's good-bye; we'll never meet again!
            
            KULIGIN. Who knows! [Wipes his eyes; smiles] Here I've started crying!
            
            IRINA. We'll meet again sometime.
            
            FEDOTIK. After ten years--or fifteen? We'll hardly know one another
            then; we'll say, "How do you do?" coldly.... [Takes a snapshot] Keep
            still.... Once more, for the last time.
            
            RODE. [Embracing TUZENBACH] We shan't meet again.... [Kisses IRINA'S
            hand] Thank you for everything, for everything!
