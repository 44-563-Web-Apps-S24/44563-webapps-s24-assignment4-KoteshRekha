        <h2>The Theree Sisters Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p class="direction">[The old garden at the house of the PROSOROVS. There is a long avenue
            of firs, at the end of which the river can be seen. There is a forest
            on the far side of the river. On the right is the terrace of the house:
            bottles and tumblers are on a table here; it is evident that champagne
            has just been drunk. It is midday. Every now and again passers-by walk
            across the garden, from the road to the river; five soldiers go past
            rapidly. CHEBUTIKIN, in a comfortable frame of mind which does not
            desert him throughout the act, sits in an armchair in the garden,
            waiting to be called. He wears a peaked cap and has a stick. IRINA,
            KULIGIN with a cross hanging from his neck and without his moustaches,
            and TUZENBACH are standing on the terrace seeing off FEDOTIK and RODE,
            who are coming down into the garden; both officers are in service
            uniform.]</p>
